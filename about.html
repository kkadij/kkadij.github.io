        <h2>More About My Interests</h2>
        <p>
            Hello! My name is Kadijah Keita, and I’m excited to share a bit about myself. I’m passionate about anime, Premier League soccer, and cooking. One of my all-time favorite anime is One Piece.
            I love the adventures of Luffy and his crew as they travel the seas in search of treasure and friendship. The story really resonates with me, especially its themes of perseverance and following your dreams.
            There’s something magical about the way anime can transport you to different worlds while teaching valuable life lessons. When I’m not binge-watching anime, you can usually find me cheering for my favorite Premier League team, Chelsea.
            Soccer has a special place in my heart. I enjoy the energy of the matches, the thrill of celebrating goals, and the sense of camaraderie that comes with being part of the fan community. Watching my favorite players give their all on the field motivates me to stay active and strive for my own goals.
            I’ve also developed a love for cooking, and I’ve been exercising while discovering healthy recipes to try out. It’s been a rewarding journey, finding ways to enjoy delicious meals while staying fit. I believe that cooking is not just about nourishment; it’s a way to express creativity and share love with others.
