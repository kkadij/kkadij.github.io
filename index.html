        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I’m Kadijah Keita. I have a variety of interests that keep me entertained and engaged. I've been into anime and Premier League soccer since I was young. I enjoy the creativity and storytelling in anime, which always offers something new and exciting. Soccer has also been a passion of mine, providing an energetic way to enjoy games and connect with others who share the same interest.
            In addition to these hobbies, I love cooking and have recently been exploring healthy recipes. It's fun to try out new dishes while making sure they’re good for my health. Cooking feels like a creative outlet for me, and I appreciate the process of preparing meals that I can share with friends and family.
            I also enjoy reading, especially about different cultures and experiences. Learning about new topics broadens my perspective and keeps life interesting. Overall, I like to find joy in my interests, whether it’s watching a new anime series, cheering for my favorite team, or experimenting in the kitchen. I believe that having diverse hobbies enriches life and helps us connect with others in meaningful ways.
            My favorite animals are camels!
